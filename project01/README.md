You can still display the CSS2.1 valid logo.
3. Site Structure

    2. Navigation bars on every page
5. Aesthetics
    1. The site should have a consistent look and feel (make sure you use external style sheets for formatting)
    2. While maintain a sense of belonging to the site, each page has to be different to show locality so readers know they are on the same site but browsing different pages (make sure you use inline and embedded styles)
    3. The design theme should agree with the site purpose and meet the needs and taste of potential audience
    4. Most importantly, make sure the foreground and background are contrasting well and good typography is used
    5. Sensible use of images and other multi-media formats.
6. Hyperlinks
    1. Use relative URLs to ensure portability
    2. Make sure no broken images or broken links
7. Appropriate use the following techniques and provide a README file (can be in plain text) to document the rationale and how you used them. This README file should also help the project marker to locate which pages contain the required technique.
    * Form Controls
    * CSS
    * Client-side Programming: Javascript - Basic form validation
    * Demonstrating the use of DHTML (A combination of CSS, JavaScript, DOM and Event Models)
8. Page Layout needs to be done by CSS positioning, no layout tables are allowed.
9. Use of free images, free website template, free video clips and multimedia files obtained from the Web is permitted, but you will need to provide a separate Reference Page for the site (in addition to the 5+ required pages). Copyright materials must get permission before use.

## Pages

* index.html - Login Page
* home.html - Main Page
* jobs_list.html - Shows Jobs
* jobs_search.html - Search Jobs
* details.html - Shows details for a job
* users_list.html - List users
* users_search.html - Search Users

Pages above [HAVE | HAVE NOT] been tested as HTML5 strict and CSS2.1 Valid

All pages (excluding the login page) contain the same navigation menu

Pages are mostly linear, however it makes sense to go from jobs to users and vice versa

All pages (excluding login) use the same structure and CSS stylesheets. (Also, black and white is always a good idea)

Links [HAVE | HAVE NOT] been tested to make sure they are noty dead. And they are all relative.

CSS has been used for page layouts. Excluding places where tables make sense. Like tabulated data.

A reference page [DOES | DOES NOT] exists at reference.html
